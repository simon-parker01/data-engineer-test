# data-engineer-test

This project takes weather data in a CSV format and transforms it into parquet suitable for querying.

# Folders

* ## Pandas
  * This folder contains a jupyter notebook used to investigate the data provided
  * It also contains the data in CSV and parquet format

* ##  Glue
  * This folder contains an AWS glue ETL script (including tests). Taking the data from  CSV files in one s3 bucket and writing it to another as  a parquet file
  * Also contains the parquet files generated by the ETL
  * Contains a list of assumptions made about the data
  * ### Athena
    * Contains an athena query to answer the question "When and where was the hotteset day"
 
**Note** This ETL makes use of two AWS Glue crawlers to populate a data cataglue. One to catalogue the CSV data in the s3 bucket fur use by the glue script and one to catalogue the parquet data for use in Athena. The Glue job will fail if the CSV doesn't contain data in the format specficed in the Glue data catalgue
